- [Game Object](#): a game object represents any entity inside of your scene (ex. the main camera). All game objects share a similar hierarchy. They always start witha transformed script.
- [Scene](#): a scene represetns the curent state of your game. You can have multiple scenes that represent individual levels of a game. You can use scenes for a splash screen, or for game over screens, or you can put all of your game content into a single screen, and use coding to hide and show the elements that you need, based on the state of the game. 
- [Sprite](#): a sprite represents any image that would be rendered in a scene.
- [Sprite Renderer](#): the Sprite Renderer allows you to display a texture which would represent the sprite in the scene.
