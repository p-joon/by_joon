# Glossary
- [Asset Package](#): an asset pakcage is a self contained collection of scirpts, or artwork, or even full game source code, that you can add to a project, when starting from scratch.
- [Components](#): additional empty game objects(scripts) that add additional functionality to a game object to make them work.
- [Deferred Execution](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/charlie/2007/12/10/linq-and-deferred-execution/)
- [Draw Calls](#): a draw call represents a single draw from a texture to the display. Ideally, you want to have the least amount of draw calls possible.
- [Game Object](#): a game object represents any entity inside of your scene (ex. the main camera). A game object not only allows us to visualize what's in the object itself, but it also includes the code we need to make it work.
- [Parallax Scrolling](#): when the background moves slower than the foreground to give the sense of dpeth without actually using real 3D space.
- [Scene](#): a scene represetns the curent state of your game. You can have multiple scenes that represent individual levels of a game. You can use scenes for a splash screen, or for game over screens, or you can put all of your game content into a single screen, and use coding to hide and show the elements that you need, based on the state of the game. 
- [Sprite](#): a sprite represents any image that would be rendered in a scene.
- [Sprite Renderer](#): the Sprite Renderer allows you to display a texture which would represent the sprite in the scene.
- [String Constant Pool](https://www.journaldev.com/797/what-is-java-string-pool): While the String object is immutable, its reference variable is not. As applications grow, it's very common for string literals to occupy a large area of memory, which can even cause redundancy. In order to make Java more efficient, the JVM sets aside a special area of memory called "string constant pool"
